# About Frank's Redhot

### Concept
We wanted to learn more about circuit analysis by building a circuit analysis software. In order
to scope our project correctly, we decided to focus on the kinds of things we would've found 
helpful in our introductory circuits class, ISIM (Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and
Measurements).
