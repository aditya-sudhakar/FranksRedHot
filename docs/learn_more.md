# About Frank's Red Hot

### Concept
We wanted to learn more about circuit analysis by building a circuit analysis software, or SPICE
(Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) software. In order to scope our project 
correctly, we decided to focus on the kinds of things we would've found helpful in our introductory
circuits class, ISIM (Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurements). We also wanted 
to have a focus on having a good user interface, since current SPICE software has a clunky, 
90's-looking aesthetic.
